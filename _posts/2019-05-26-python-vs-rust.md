I need a way to quickly get into the mindset of using Python or Rust. I switch programming languages a lot and everytime I need to add an element to a list or define use a specific type I need to look stuff up on the internet.

This simplistic comparison will hopefully help me get on track as fast as possible.

```rust
fn test_function(x: u32) -> Option<u32> {
    Some(5)
}
```

```python
def test_function(x, y):
        return x*y
```

| Python | Rust |
|-------|-------|
|
```python
a = 5
```|
```rust
let a = 5; 
```|
